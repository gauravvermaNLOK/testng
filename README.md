ðŸš€ Understanding Assertions in TestNG: Hard vs. Soft ðŸš€

Assertions are fundamental in testing, allowing developers to validate results effectively. In TestNG, a powerful Java testing framework, two main types of assertions can be utilized:

ðŸ”¹ Hard Assertions: These halt the execution of a test when a failure occurs. For example, the Assert class under org.testng.Assert immediately stops further execution if an expected condition is not met.

ðŸ”¹ Soft Assertions: These allow tests to continue running regardless of failures. Using the SoftAssert class from org.testng.asserts, testers can gather multiple failure logs and report them at the end of the test.
